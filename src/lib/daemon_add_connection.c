/**
 * Add another client connection to the set of connections managed by
 * MHD.  This API is usually not needed (since MHD will accept inbound
 * connections on the server socket).  Use this API in special cases,
 * for example if your HTTP server is behind NAT and needs to connect
 * out to the HTTP client, or if you are building a proxy.
 *
 * If you use this API in conjunction with a internal select or a
 * thread pool, you must set the option
 * #MHD_USE_ITC to ensure that the freshly added
 * connection is immediately processed by MHD.
 *
 * The given client socket will be managed (and closed!) by MHD after
 * this call and must no longer be used directly by the application
 * afterwards.
 *
 * @param daemon daemon that manages the connection
 * @param client_socket socket to manage (MHD will expect
 *        to receive an HTTP request from this socket next).
 * @param addr IP address of the client
 * @param addrlen number of bytes in @a addr
 * @return #MHD_SC_OK on success
 *        The socket will be closed in any case; `errno` is
 *        set to indicate further details about the error.
